Hi [Dcm](_en-us_users_na_.md)

In general, scaling should be based on application workload (CPU, memory, I/O, network), not just the number of users, since user activity patterns vary. However, as a rough guideline you can consider:

**Standard (S1–S3):** Best for small production workloads, light to moderate traffic.

**Premium v2/v3 (P1v2, P2v3, etc.):** Recommended for medium to large production workloads, improved performance, advanced scaling, and VNET integration.

**Isolated (I1–I3):** For high-security, compliance, or enterprise workloads requiring isolation.

Instead of mapping plans directly to user counts, monitor App Service metrics (CPU %, memory, HTTP queue length, response time) and scale up/down accordingly.

Azure also supports autoscaling, which helps manage cost-effectiveness while ensuring performance.

#### _en-us_answers_questions_5578651_unable-to-deploy-my-azure-functions.md

> Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/5578651/unable-to-deploy-my-azure-functions
> Scraped: 11/5/2025, 2:45:42 AM

Quick Fix: Resolve “Free VMs” Quota Issue for Azure Functions

1.  Switch to Premium or Dedicated Plan

If you're deploying to a Consumption Plan, Azure may attempt to use internal Free VM SKUs. To bypass this:

Deploy your Function App using a Premium Plan (Elastic Premium) or App Service Plan

az functionapp plan create --name myPremiumPlan --resource-group myRG --location westeurope --sku EP1



This avoids quota issues tied to Free VMs.

1.  Request Quota Increase (Hidden SKU)

The Free VM SKU is not visible in the Azure Portal's quota UI. To request it:

Go to Azure Quotas

Select your subscription and region

Choose "Compute" → then "Other VM SKUs"

In the request form, manually specify:

“Please increase quota for Free VM SKU required for Azure Functions deployment in \[Region\]”

Microsoft support will process this hidden quota request.

1.  Alternative: Deploy to a Different Region

Some regions have default Free VM quota available. Try deploying to:

East US

West Europe

North Europe

This is a quick workaround if quota increase is delayed.Quick Fix: Resolve “Free VMs” Quota Issue for Azure Functions

1.  Switch to Premium or Dedicated Plan

If you're deploying to a Consumption Plan, Azure may attempt to use internal Free VM SKUs. To bypass this:

Deploy your Function App using a Premium Plan (Elastic Premium) or App Service Plan

az functionapp plan create --name myPremiumPlan --resource-group myRG --location westeurope --sku EP1

This avoids quota issues tied to Free VMs.

1.  Request Quota Increase (Hidden SKU)

The Free VM SKU is not visible in the Azure Portal's quota UI. To request it:

Go to Azure Quotas

Select your subscription and region

Choose "Compute" → then "Other VM SKUs"

In the request form, manually specify:

“Please increase quota for Free VM SKU required for Azure Functions deployment in \[Region\]”

Microsoft support will process this hidden quota request.

1.  Alternative: Deploy to a Different Region

Some regions have default Free VM quota available. Try deploying to:

East US

West Europe

North Europe

This is a quick workaround if quota increase is delayed.

Hello [Jake](_en-us_users_na_.md),

Welcome to Microsoft Q&A, As far as I know there's no built-in support for dynamic schema injection at runtime.

> To use this action, you must specify a JSON schema that defines the structure of the content. [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-overview#parse-json-action](_en-us_azure_logic-apps_logic-apps-enterprise-integration-overview.md#parse-json-action)

This implies the schema must be predefined at design time. There's no mention of runtime schema injection or dynamic selection, and no supported method to bind external schemas dynamically. The doc also links to static schema examples, reinforcing that dynamic schema loading isn't part of the feature set.

However, you can work around this by using inline code or pre-processing steps to conditionally select and parse JSON based on known schema variants. Integration accounts or asset management features can store schemas, but they can't dynamically bind them to Parse JSON. For dynamic parsing, consider using Azure Functions or inline JavaScript to handle schema logic before passing structured data downstream.

With the above points in mind I am looking for the best way of doing this, especially when taking into account the decoupled nature of the Public IP address and APIM instance (since the below is now apparently possible also).

![User's image](https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/2b19e464-4a2b-4c51-88b8-a159e9b4d0bc?platform=QnA)

Questions include:

1.  Is an APIM instance with the managed "no public IP" option (May 2024) only available for newly built APIM instances and not pre-existing?
2.  If no then how would you upgrade to a managed option from pre-existing APIM?
3.  If yes what are the concerns about future proofing the environment, were the non-managed/decoupled option ever to become EOL.

Appreciate any constructive responses, thanks!

    Hi [Eddie Vincent](_en-us_users_na_.md),
    
    Thanks for reaching out to Microsoft Q&A,
    
    1.  Pre-2024 APIM instances cannot directly switch to the fully managed “no public IP” option; it’s only available for new deployments.
    2.  Zone redundancy requires adding multiple units and specifying availability zones in the `locations` section.
    3.  Existing public IPs can be decoupled, but upgrading to a managed zone-redundant IP usually requires creating a new IP.
    4.  Future-proofing favors using decoupled or managed IPs to simplify scaling and ensure resiliency.
    5.  Migration to a new managed APIM instance is recommended for full AZ and managed IP benefits.
    6.  Deployment via ARM/Bicep/terraform allows code-driven updates of units, zones, and public IP assignments.
    
    Hope it helps!

    One more question for you, are you aware why when I try and disassociate the public IP address from APIM it tells me to disassociate first from a loadbalancer which (as far as I can see) does not exist in my Azure tenant.
    
    ![User's image](https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/c095ba08-78dc-4229-8cbb-3071b7fd2968?platform=QnA)
    
    On clicking the link for this phantom load balancer I am provided with an error of "The access token is from the wrong issuer" despite also being an Owner in RBAC for this subscription.
    
    Is this something legacy from the older version of APIM/Public IP, or baked in? any thoughts would be appreciated.

Hi Team,

I need assistance on SQL vm on azure, I am trying to migrate monthly backup to archive storage. before that i would like to estimate the cost difference on the current rsv storage consumption and cost with vault storage and cost. As I checked post 45 days to 180 days backup are eligible for vault archive, so in this case full backup only eligible, do you have any script to get the full backup size alone for all the instance so that i can calculate size and cost difference?

Hi **[Mej](_en-us_users_na_.md),**

Thanks for posting your question in Microsoft Q&A forum

As you can see in provided Microsoft official document,

You must have a Microsoft Customer Agreement - enterprise billing account to use associated billing tenants. An enterprise billing account is a billing account that is created by working with a Microsoft sales representative.

If you don't have one, you don't see the **Associated billing tenants** option in the Azure portal. You also can't move subscriptions to other tenants or assign roles to users in other tenants.

To learn more about types of billing accounts, see [Billing accounts and scopes in the Azure portal](_en-us_azure_cost-management-billing_manage_view-all-accounts.md).

You may need to work with your Microsoft account manager or sales representative to set up an enterprise Microsoft Customer Agreement billing account.

Or Use [Microsoft support](https://portal.azure.cn/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/NewSupportRequestV3Blade) in the Azure portal.

I hope the provided answer is helpful, do let me know if you have any further questions on this Please accept as Yes if the answer is helpful so that it can help others in the community.

Thank you for reaching out on Microsoft Q&A.

To use the latest **Face API** in **Azure AI Vision Studio**, ensure your Azure resource and SDKs are upgraded to the current supported versions. Use a **Face** or **Azure AI Services (multi-service)** resource as described in the [Face service overview](_azure_ai-services_computer-vision_overview-identity.md). Update your SDKs to the latest release — for Python, run `pip install --upgrade azure-ai-vision-face`, and for .NET, update the **Azure.AI.Vision.Face** NuGet package as shown in the [Quickstart – Face client library](_azure_ai-services_computer-vision_quickstarts-sdk_identity-client-library.md). When making API calls, set `detectionModel=detection_03` and `recognitionModel=recognition_04` to align with the latest supported models ([Face detection models](_azure_ai-services_computer-vision_how-to_identity-detect-faces.md)). Note that attributes such as _age_, _gender_, and _emotion_ are deprecated for new users under Responsible AI compliance. Finally, open [Vision Studio](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/), connect your updated resource, and verify that face detection and recognition operate correctly using the latest models.

Hello Rupesh Asati,

We are observing failures behaviors in our Azure DevOps release pipelines. The affected stage is the Azure CLI task within our release pipeline(Deployment). This issue is impacting production releases and causing business disruption. Please review the details below and advise on an immediate resolution or provide an ETA.

Observed Behavior: Noticed this behavior on November 30th and 31st 2025  
[Screenshot 2025-11-02 141401.png](https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/bc41ccb5-afce-4256-96ba-86b6d7aef434?platform=QnA)

**Initially - November 30–31, 2025**

Triggered Pipelines initialize successfully and complete build and artifact download steps without issue.

In release pipeline, During the Azure CLI step, the process runs for approximately 60 minutes before failing with:  
TF400893: Unable to contact the server. This is most likely caused by a network error.

The error occurs everytime, but once triggered, the task exits with ##\[error\]Script failed with exit code: 1 and the agent disconnects.

Prior steps in the release pipeline (AzCopy to Blob, AKS deployment preparation, etc.) complete successfully. No recent changes were made to the YAML, task configuration, or service connection.

**Current update - Noticed this behavior on November 2 2025** The release pipelines are still falling but they don't persist for 60 mins is fails instantly and the following error was observed in the logs

ERROR: (BadRequest) All Changes to Azure Frontdoor Configuration are blocked currently. Code: BadRequest Message: All Changes to Azure Frontdoor Configuration are blocked currently. ##\[error\]Script failed with exit code: 1

Hi,

Interesting design question that I would like to get a clear cut response on if anyone has any experience.

**Question**: If you are using something legacy on premise (such as Sharepoint 2016 server with NTLM authentication) and want to integrate with a frontend Azure service (such as APIM) what would be the best approach?

![User's image](https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/deaf145b-c5f6-414a-8fa5-f50af85c7861?platform=QnA)

I was looking at Entra Application proxy as a solution but on researching have found the following points to be problematic:

*   Comment here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/568665/api-backend-is-on-premise-ntlm-system](_en-us_answers_questions_568665_api-backend-is-on-premise-ntlm-system.md) "NTLM authentication to **authenticate backend calls is not supported**."
*   But then I have read in other articles statements such as "Azure AD proxy can be used to publish applications that use NTLM by acting as an intermediary for authentication.
*   And I believe the below is from a MS frequently asked questions page which is probably the most reliable source of truth.

![User's image](https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/c513474c-f774-44ec-aeb7-3f6ac1c8102d?platform=QnA)

So if NTLM just not going to be an option here in any scenario (including ADFS) ? what would be the recommended or supported way to go if you have deployed something similar? I would like to avoid switching to another authentication method (such as Kerberos) if it can be avoided also.

Thanks!

    Hi [@Eddie Vincent](_users_na_.md) ,
    
    Welcome to the Microsoft Q&A Platform! Thank you for asking your question here.
    
    NTLM is not directly supported by APIM for backend authentication. The recommended, Microsoft-aligned pattern is to either:
    
    1.  Introduce a **middleware layer** that performs NTLM internally, or
    2.  **Modernize** backend components to support OAuth2 / certificate-based auth, and
    3.  Use APIM’s **custom policies** to securely bridge authentication boundaries.
    
    Please find below possible solutions for this.
    
    *   **Implement a Middleware or Facade Layer:** If your backend cannot move away from NTLM, consider deploying a lightweight middleware (e.g., an on-prem API, Azure Function hosted in VNET, or a containerized service). This layer would:
        *   Authenticate to the legacy backend using NTLM internally.
        *   Expose a modern authentication interface (such as OAuth 2.0, certificate-based, or Basic Auth over HTTPS) for APIM to consume.
        *   Allow you to decouple the legacy NTLM dependency from APIM.
    *   **Explore Custom Policies in APIM:** APIM allows custom **inbound** and **backend** policies that can manipulate headers, tokens, and credentials before forwarding requests. While APIM does not natively perform NTLM authentication, you can use policies to pass required credentials or tokens if another intermediary handles NTLM. Examples include:
        *   Using `set-header` or `authentication-managed-identity` policies to authenticate to a backend that supports modern auth.
        *   Combining with Azure Key Vault for secret management.
    *   **Modernize Using Azure Functions or Logic Apps:** If possible, you can migrate parts of the legacy logic into Azure Functions or Logic Apps:
        *   These services support modern authentication natively (Azure AD, MSI, etc.).
        *   You can then securely expose them through APIM as standard REST endpoints.
        *   This reduces the dependency on NTLM and simplifies long-term maintenance.

Hi **[Wenqi He (RED HAT INC)](_en-us_users_na_.md),**

Thanks for posting your question in Microsoft Q&A portal

Yes, Managed Identities are soft deleted for 30 days. You can view the soft deleted managed identity service principal, but you can't restore or permanently delete it and During this retention period, the soft-deleted identities still count against your tenant quota in Microsoft Entra ID. Unfortunately, this soft-delete period is fixed by Microsoft and cannot be configured or shortened.

After 30 days, these managed identities are permanently removed and stop counting against the quota. This behavior applies to managed identities as special types of service principals that are managed by Azure. As **[Byron Liu](_en-us_users_na_.md)** mentioned there isn't a supported way to bypass or purge soft-deleted managed identities before that period ends.

Refer document:

Hi [Pål Kristian Halle](_en-us_users_na_.md),

Thank you for sharing your feedback. We have looked into the possible alternatives, and here are some steps that may help address the issue:

You are right about how make\_list() works—it doesn’t keep the order unless you explicitly sort the data first. The catch is that adding a sort step before summarizing can slow things down, which explains the performance hit you noticed.

Here’s why that happens and what you can try instead:

Why does order by slow things down?

*   By default, summarize in Kusto works on unordered data.
*   When you add order by Timestamp asc, it forces a full sort across all rows before aggregation, which is costly for large datasets (think hundreds of thousands of rows).
*   The union method is faster because it skips the global sort and handles each metric separately.

Ways to improve performance:

*   Use arg\_min / arg\_max for first row only
    *   Great for single-row retrieval per metric, but not for N rows.
    *   Chunked approach with take after filtering
        *   If you can tolerate approximate results:

`KQL`

`Metrics`

`| where MetricId in (1001, 1011, 1021)`

`| where Timestamp >= datetime(2024-06-01)`

`| partition by MetricId`

`| take N`

*   Limitation: Doesn’t guarantee strict ordering by timestamp.
*   mv-expand + top inside summarize
    *   Instead of global sort, sort within each group:

`KQL`

`Metrics`

`| where MetricId in (1001, 1011, 1021)`

`| where Timestamp >= datetime(2024-06-01)`

`| summarize readings = make_list(pack('t', Timestamp, 'v', Value)) by MetricId`

`| mv-expand readings`

`| order by MetricId, readings.t asc`

*   This reduces the cost of sorting across all rows.
*   Union-based approach for strict ordering
    *   If metrics list is small and static:

`KQL`

`union (`

`Metrics | where MetricId == 1001 | where Timestamp >= datetime(2024-06-01) | top N by Timestamp asc,`

`Metrics | where MetricId == 1011 | where Timestamp >= datetime(2024-06-01) | top N by Timestamp asc,`

`Metrics | where MetricId == 1021 | where Timestamp >= datetime(2024-06-01) | top N by Timestamp asc`

`)`

*   This avoids global sorts and is often fastest for small metric sets.

There’s no built-in way for make\_list() to keep the order unless you sort the data first. If maintaining order is important, using a union or a partitioned approach is usually the most practical solution.

Hello Microsoft Team,

We are currently unable to perform **CDN purge operations** on our Azure CDN profile in the **West Europe (WE)** region.

Upon checking the Azure status update, we found the following notice:

> _Between 15:45 UTC on 29 October and 00:05 UTC on 30 October 2025, customers and Microsoft services leveraging Azure Front Door (AFD) and Azure CDN (classic) experienced latencies, timeouts, and errors. The data plane was fully mitigated at 00:05 UTC on 30 October 2025. Out of an abundance of caution, all service management operations (create, update, delete, purges) by customers to AFD and Azure CDN profiles are temporarily blocked. Microsoft will notify customers once the restriction is lifted._

Could you please confirm the following:

The **current status** of the service management operation block for Azure CDN and Front Door?

Any **estimated timeline (ETA)** for when purge operations will be re-enabled?

Whether there is any **recommended workaround** for content invalidation until the purge restriction is lifted?

Thank you for your support and clarification.

**Region:** West Europe (WE) **Location:** India **Service Impacted:** Azure CDN (Classic) **Impact:** Unable to perform CDN purge or related management operations.

As I understand, this "**terminationGracePeriodSeconds**" is used to configure the waiting time before to shutdown a replica after it signal a SIGTERM to my application deployed in Azure Container App.

Also the default value is null, and a 30 seconds will be applied whenever it is null?

I would like to configure this **terminationGracePeriodSeconds** settings, let say to 120 seconds. However I don't see such a option from Azure Portal. Please guide me the best / most straightforward way to configure this.

Hello,

I encountered into the situation when I try to display Dataframe. The problem is that it doesn't display any records even though Dataframe has records (df.count() returns value of records in dataframe, so its not empty dataframe, df.show() works fine as well). I tried to investigate what caused this problem and still not found the solution.

Also tried with SQL API, some columns work fine (mostly integer type), but string columns data are not returned.

Databricks configuration:

1.  Premium service plan;
2.  PrivateLink enabled;
3.  Cluster is Personal Compute, using 17.3 LTS runtime (ran same code with 16.4 LTS - identical problem);
4.  Data is read from external ADLS.

    Hello , Welcome to MS Q&A
    
    It seems like you are experiencing an issue with displaying string columns in a DataFrame on Databricks, even though the DataFrame is not empty. This could be related to the configuration or runtime environment. Here are a few things you might want to check or try:
    
    1.  **Data Type Recognition**: Ensure that the data types of the string columns are correctly recognized by Spark SQL. Sometimes, if the data type is not recognized, it might not display correctly. You can refer to the [Spark SQL documentation](_en-us_azure_databricks_error-messages_error-classes.md#databricks-runtime-and-databricks-sql) for a list of valid data types.
    2.  **Schema Definition**: Verify that the schema of your DataFrame is correctly defined. You can manually define the schema if necessary to ensure that all columns, especially string columns, are correctly interpreted.
    3.  **Runtime Version**: Since you mentioned using different runtime versions (17.3 LTS and 16.4 LTS), ensure that there are no known issues with these versions related to string column handling. You can check the [Databricks Runtime maintenance updates](_en-us_azure_databricks_release-notes_runtime_maintenance-updates.md#databricks-runtime-releases) for any relevant bug fixes or changes.
    4.  **PrivateLink Configuration**: Since PrivateLink is enabled, ensure that there are no network-related issues affecting the data retrieval from ADLS. Network configurations can sometimes impact data access and display.
    
    Kindly check and let us know if any questions
    
    Thanks
    
    Deepanshu

#### _en-us_answers_questions_5609748_support-for-mlflow-3-x-x-in-azure-ml.md

> Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/5609748/support-for-mlflow-3-x-x-in-azure-ml

**Hi [Daniel Gröger](_en-us_users_na_.md),**

Azure Machine Learning is MLflow‑compatible for tracking, logging, model registration, and deployment. You can use current MLflow packages (e.g., `mlflow` / `mlflow‑skinny`) with Azure ML today for experiment tracking and to deploy MLflow models to online or batch endpoints.

MLflow 3 introduced new capabilities (such as Logged Models, expanded registry views, and GenAI‑centric tracing/evaluation). These are documented in the MLflow 3 materials and are fully available in Databricks‑managed MLflow; the Azure ML documentation currently emphasizes the established MLflow integration for tracking and deployment rather than these newer 3.x‑specific features.

**How to proceed now:**

1.  **Use Azure ML as the MLflow tracking server** by pointing your code to the workspace; continue to log runs, metrics, parameters, and artifacts with MLflow.
2.  **Register and deploy MLflow models** to Azure ML endpoints. Azure ML supports no‑code deployment for MLflow models and autogenerates the scoring environment from the model’s `conda.yaml`.
3.  If you specifically need **MLflow 3 features like Logged Models and end‑to‑end 3.x registry views**, consider running those workflows in Databricks‑managed MLflow and where appropriate promoting artifacts to Azure ML for serving.

**Links for setup and details:**   MLflow + Azure ML overview and compatibility: [MLflow and Azure Machine Learning](_en-us_azure_machine-learning_concept-mlflow.md)
*   Deploy MLflow models on Azure ML (no‑code & custom options): [Guidelines for deploying MLflow models](_en-us_azure_machine-learning_how-to-deploy-mlflow-models.md)
*   MLflow 3 summary & docs: [MLflow 3 overview](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/mlflow-3) • [MLflow releases](https://mlflow.org/releases)

**If you’re hitting a specific issue** (for example, model logging compatibility or a package conflict during deployment), please share:

*   your `mlflow` package version,
*   the `conda.yaml`/environment spec, and
*   the exact error text or job log snippet.

That will help us provide a targeted to fix.

## Frequently asked questions

How do I become a Microsoft Learn contributor?

There's more than one way to become a contributor! While editing documentation is the most popular method, you can also answer questions in Microsoft Q&A, leave feedback on documentation and training content, create a collection of content for others to consume, or file a GitHub issue if you spot problems in open-source product documentation but don't have the tools to fix them yourself.

What accounts do contributors need?

We recommend having a Microsoft Learn account and a GitHub account. A Microsoft Learn account allows you to contribute to Q&A and create collections, while a GitHub account allows you to edit our documentation or file an issue about open-source product documentation.

How do I start contributing to Microsoft Learn documentation?

Check out our contributor guide! Start with the article on [how to get started](_en-us_contribute_content_.md#how-do-i-start). You'll find a table that guides you to documentation for each contribution type and lists the account you'll need for each option.

No! You don't need any special credentials or experience to contribute, just a desire to participate in the community.

What's in it for me?

Contributing to Microsoft Learn benefits not only our learners but also YOU! When you edit documentation, your name appears in the list of contributors at the top of the article. Your commits to our GitHub repos will show up in your GitHub commit history, which is a great way to demonstrate your passion for a particular technology while also building your portfolio.

## Where your Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform customer data is stored

Customer data for Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform is stored in Microsoft Azure datacenters located in various geographic regions around the world. Customers can choose the region (also referred to as "geo") where their customer data will be stored.

Microsoft may replicate [customer data](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/customer-data-definitions) to other regions within the same geo for data durability, except where otherwise specified.

## Regions where Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform can be deployed

Explore service availability and deployment regions in [Dynamics 365 and Power Platform Availability Reports](https://releaseplans.microsoft.com/availability-reports/?report=productgeoreport).

Note

*   Because there is only one region in Brazil, customer data in Brazil South may be replicated to South Central US (Texas) for disaster recovery purposes.
    
*   For China-specific information, learn more [here](https://www.trustcenter.cn/default.html).
    

## Storing customer data at rest in geo

Microsoft will store customer data at rest in the selected Azure geographic location (geo) for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform products except when:

*   It is necessary for Microsoft to provide customer support, troubleshoot the service, or comply with legal requirements.
    
*   Customers use services that are designed to operate globally, including the following services:
    
    *   **Dynamics 365 and Power Platform home page and admin center portals**, which store application names, descriptions, and logos globally for performance.
        
    *   **Entra ID** which may store Active Directory data globally.  
        [You can find more information here](_en-us_azure_active-directory_active-directory-whatis.md).
        
    *   **Azure Multi-Factor Authentication**, which may store multi-factor authentication data globally.  
        [You can find more information here](_en-us_azure_active-directory_authentication_concept-mfa-howitworks.md).
        
    *   **Customer data collected during the onboarding process by the Microsoft 365 Admin Center**.  
        [You can find more information here](https://support.office.com/article/About-the-Office-365-Admin-Center-758befc4-0888-4009-9f14-0d147402fd23).
        
    *   **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**, which provides a global caching service and stores customer data at edge locations around the world.
        
    *   **Dataverse table and column names** (formerly called entity and field names) are replicated globally for support and troubleshooting purposes, but the content within those database tables remains stored in geo.
        
    *   **Services that provide global routing functions** and do not process or store customer data. This type of service includes **Azure DNS**, which provides domain name services that route to different regions.
        
    *   **Preview, beta, or other pre-release services**, which typically store customer data in the United States but may store it globally.
        
*   Customers use features that are powered by Microsoft 365 services as described in product documentation. For these features, data will be transferred to Microsoft 365 services and governed by [Microsoft 365 terms and data residency commitments.](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/PrivacyandSecurityTerms/all)
    
*   Customers may also configure external services to extend Dynamics 365 products and Power Platform functionality. These configurations may cause customer data to be transferred outside of the selected geo. Examples include:
    
    *   **Machine Learning Cognitive Services**: If features using cognitive services are activated, customer data for domains such as product recommendations and demand forecasting may be synchronized outside of the configured region. Use of these features is optional. [You can find more information here](_en-us_azure_cognitive-services_.md).
        
    *   **Data integration**: When using Dynamics 365 or Power Platform to work with external services (Microsoft or third-party), customer data may be transferred outside the configured production environment to a geographic location designated by the customer.  
        **Microsoft Power Apps, and Microsoft Power Automate**: When connected to Dynamics 365 products, customer data may be sent outside of the designated region to where these services are deployed.
        
    *   **Azure Dev Ops:** Customers can choose where to store custom code, metadata, and data assets that support their Dynamics 365 implementation. You can find more information about the availability of Visual Studio Team Services [here.](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/?v=17.42n)
        
    *   **Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services:** The administration portal stores certain customer data on servers located in the United States such as:
        
        *   Your code or metadata, and data packages (for example, master or application configuration data) to support application lifecycle;
            
        *   Business process models and task guides;
            
        *   Usage and diagnostic logs during the application lifecycle process; and Content related to support requests submitted to Microsoft such as support issues, service requests, and hotfix requests.
            
    *   Additionally, certain types of customer data specifically the application name, application description, and application logo will be stored globally.
        

Regardless of where the customer data is stored, Microsoft does not control or restrict the locations from which customers, or their end users, may access customer data.

The following products contain additional product-specific scenarios where customer data may be stored outside the selected geo. These variations reflect distinct features or positioning relevant to each service.

## Product-specific considerations

Product

Key variation

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights

Email and content delivery may operate globally. Custom schema/display names may be referenced globally, but field values remain in-geo.

Dynamics 365 Finance

Electronic invoicing may involve cross-geo transfers.

Dynamics 365 Commerce

CSU data syncs to the production instance. Fraud Protection may process data globally.

Dynamics 365 Human Resources

Provisioning service stores environment lists in the US. Teams integration may transfer data to the Teams service region.

Power Pages

Website name and URL are stored globally.

Copilot Studio

If tenant location is not listed, data is stored in the US; for France, data is stored in Europe. External configurations (for example, Customer Service hand-off, Facebook, Teams) may transfer data.

Dynamics 365 Contact Center

Use of [Azure Communication Services](_en-us_azure_communication-services_.md) for telephony and messaging purposes. In this case, customers do have the ability to choose the location where transcription and recordings are temporarily stored. The permanent storage of this data still resides in the geo where the Contact Center operates.

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and Guides

Calling and collaboration features may send customer data to the geo where customer’s Teams service is deployed.

## Policies

To ensure the digital safety of how users interact with each other in their content and their conduct, The Services has rules about what types of content and conduct are not allowed. Prohibited content will be removed. Your account may be suspended or deleted from the Services if you post harmful content.

### Bullying and harassment

We do not allow content or conduct that targets a person or group with abusive behavior. This includes any action that:

*   Harasses, intimidates, or threatens others.
*   Hurts people by insulting or belittling them.
*   Continues contact or interaction that is unwelcome, especially where contact causes others to fear injury.

### Child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA)

We do not allow the exploitation of, harm, or threat of harm to children on the Services, CSEA is any content or activity that harms or threatens to harm a child through exploitation, trafficking, extortion, or endangerment. This includes sharing visual media that contain sexual content that involves or sexualizes a child. CSEA also includes grooming, which is the inappropriate interaction with children by contacting, private messaging, or talking with a child to ask for or offer sex or sexual content, sharing content that is sexually suggestive, and planning to meet with a child for sexual encounters. A child is anyone under 18 years old or who has not reached the age of majority under applicable law.

We will automatically delete the Microsoft Learn account of any user posting CSEA.

### Coordination of harm

The Services should never be used to hurt people, including by working with others to cause physical harm. Cooperating or making specific plans with others with the shared purpose of harming someone physically is not allowed.

### Graphic violence and gore

Real-world violent content can be disturbing, offensive, or even traumatic for users.

We do not permit any visual content that promotes real-world violence or human gore.

This may include images or videos that show:

*   Real acts of serious physical harm or death against a person or group.
*   Violent domestic abuse against a real person or people.
*   Severe effects or physical trauma, such as internal organs or tissues, burnt remains of a person, severed limbs, or beheading.

### Hate speech and discrimination

We do not allow hateful content that attacks, insults, or degrades someone because of a protected trait, such as their race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, age, disability status, or caste.

Hate speech includes:

*   Promoting harmful stereotypes about people because of a protected trait.
*   Dehumanizing statements, such as comparing someone to an animal or other non-human, because of a protected trait.
*   Encouraging or supporting violence against someone because of a protected trait.
*   Calling for segregation, exclusion, or intimidation of people because of their protected trait.
*   Symbols, logos, or other images that are recognized as communicating hatred or racial superiority.

### Non-consensual intimate imagery & intimate extortion

We do not allow the sharing of sexually intimate images of someone without their permission—also called non-consensual intimate imagery, or NCII. We do not allow NCII to be distributed on our services, nor do we allow any content that praises, supports, or request NCII.

In general, if a video or image has the following traits, we treat it as NCII:

*   It was taken privately, not in a professional setting.
*   It shows sexual activity, nudity, or a sexualized body part. 
*   The person shown in the imagery didn’t agree to either the creation or the sharing of the imagery.

Additionally, Microsoft does not allow any threats to share or publish NCII—also called intimate extortion. This includes asking for or threatening a person to get money, images, or other value things in exchange for not making the NCII public. 

### Sexual solicitation

We do not allow people to use its products and services to ask for or offer sex, sexual services, or sexual content in exchange for money or something else of value.

### Suicide and self-injury

We work to remove any content about suicide and self-harm that could be dangerous. We also know that people may use our services to talk about mental health, share their stories, or join groups with others who have been affected by suicide or self-injury.

This includes the following (without limitation):

*   Supporting general ways people can end their lives, such as with a gun, hanging, or drug overdose.
*   Encouraging someone to take their life.
*   Showing images of real or attempted suicide.
*   Praising those who have died by suicide for taking their own life.

Self-injury content demonstrates, praises, or inspires physical harm to oneself, including through cutting, burning, or carving one’s skin. It also includes content that encourages or instructs on eating disorders, or systematic over or under-eating.

### Terrorism and violent extremism

We do not allow content that praises or supports terrorists or violent extremists, helps them to recruit, or encourages or enables their activities. We look to the United Nations Security Council’s Consolidated List to identify terrorists or terrorist groups. Violent extremists include people who embrace an ideology of violence or violent hatred towards another group.

We will delete the Microsoft Learn account of any user posting terrorism and violent extremism content.

### Trafficking

We do not allow any content that perpetrates human trafficking. Trafficking happens when someone exploits someone else for personal gain by depriving them of their human rights.

Trafficking commonly includes three parts:

*   The act of recurring, moving, relocating, paying for, or abducting people.
*   The use of—or threat of—force, lies, trickery, or coercion to do these activities.
*   The activities are done for money, status, or some other kind of gain.

Trafficking includes forcing people to work, marry, engage in sexual activity, or have medical treatments or operations without their consent and is not limited to any age or background.

### Violent threats, incitement, and glorification of violence

We do not permit content that encourages violence against other people through violent threats or incitement.

Threats of violence are words that show a specific intention to cause someone serious physical harm.

Incitement is material that encourages, urges, or is likely to result in serious physical harm to a person or group.

We also do not allow the glorification of violence through content that praises or supports real acts of violence causing serious physical harm to people or groups, including violence that happened in the past.

### Adult and sexual

We do not allow the use of the Services to generate or share inappropriate content or material (involving, for example, nudity, bestiality, pornography, offensive language, graphic violence, self-harm, or criminal activity).

### Profanity and vulgarity

We do not allow swearing or any other dismissive language.

### Spam

We do not allow spam or any posts that engage in phishing or the generation or distribution of malware.

Spam is unwanted or unsolicited bulk email, postings, contact requests, SMS (text messages), instant messages, or similar electronic communications.

Phishing is sending emails or other electronic communications to fraudulently or unlawfully induce recipients to reveal personal or sensitive information to gain access to accounts or records, exfiltration of documents or other sensitive information, payment and/or financial benefit.

Malware includes any activity designed to cause technical harm, such as delivering malicious executables, organizing denial of service attacks, or managing command and control servers.

### Defamation, impersonation, false information

We do not allow any activities that are fraudulent, false, or misleading (e.g., asking for money under false pretenses, impersonating someone else, defamation, manipulating the Services to increase play count, or affect rankings, ratings, or comments).

> Scraped: 11/5/2025, 2:45:34 AM

## Our principles for using AI-generated and machine-translated content on Microsoft Learn

Microsoft uses [Azure OpenAI Service](_en-us_azure_cognitive-services_openai.md) to generate some of the text and code examples that we publish on [Microsoft Learn](_en-us_.md). This article describes our approach for using Azure OpenAI to generate technical content that supports our products and services.

At Microsoft, we're working to add articles to Microsoft Learn that contain AI-generated content. Over time, more articles will feature AI-generated text and code samples.

For information about the broader effort at Microsoft to put our AI principles into practice, see [Microsoft's AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai).

## Our commitment

We're committed to providing you with accurate and comprehensive learning experiences for Microsoft products and services. By using AI-generated content, we can extend the content for your scenarios. We can provide more examples in more programming languages. We can cover solutions in greater detail. We can cover new scenarios more rapidly.

We understand that AI-generated content isn't always accurate. We test and review AI-generated content before we publish it.

## Transparency

We're transparent about articles that contain AI-generated content. All articles that contain any AI-generated content include text acknowledging the role of AI. You'll see this text at the end of the article.

## Augmentation

For articles that contain AI-generated content, our authors use AI to augment their content creation process. For example, an author plans what to cover in the article, and then uses Azure OpenAI to generate part of the content. Or, the author runs a process to convert an existing article from one programming language to another language. The author reviews and revises the AI-generated content. Finally, the author writes any remaining sections.

These articles contain a mix of authored content and AI-generated content and are clearly marked as containing AI-generated content.

## Validation

The author reviews all AI-generated content and revises it as needed. After the author has reviewed the content, the article goes through our standard validation process to check for formatting errors, and to make sure the terms and language are appropriate and inclusive. The article is eligible for publishing only after passing all validation tests.

The author tests all AI-generated code before publishing. The author either manually tests the code or runs it through an automated test process.

## AI models

Currently, we use large language models from OpenAI that we access through Azure OpenAI service to generate content.

We may add other AI services in the future and will update this page periodically to reflect our updated practices.

## Machine translation

We use Azure OpenAI advanced machine learning models and GPT large language models to augment the machine translation of learning experiences for Microsoft products and services across many of the languages we support on Microsoft Learn. Along with Azure OpenAI Services, we use translation industry standard metric models recommended by the Azure AI Translator team to ensure quality translations.

Course AI-900T00-A: Introduction to AI in Azure

## Overview

This course introduces fundamentals concepts related to artificial intelligence (AI), and the services in Microsoft Azure that can be used to create AI solutions. The course is not designed to teach students to become professional data scientists or software developers, but rather to build awareness of common AI workloads and the ability to identify Azure services to support them. The course is designed as a blended learning experience that combines instructor-led training with online materials on the Microsoft Learn platform ([https://azure.com/learn](https://azure.com/learn)). The hands-on exercises in the course are based on Learn modules, and students are encouraged to use the content on Learn as reference materials to reinforce what they learn in the class and to explore topics in more depth.

#### Audience Profile

The Introduction to AI in Azure course is designed for anyone interested in learning about the types of solution artificial intelligence (AI) makes possible, and the services on Microsoft Azure that you can use to create them. You don’t need to have any experience of using Microsoft Azure before taking this course, but a basic level of familiarity with computer technology and the Internet is assumed. Some of the concepts covered in the course require a basic understanding of mathematics, such as the ability to interpret charts. The course includes hands-on activities that involve working with data and running code, so a knowledge of fundamental programming principles will be helpful.
