    The Millions of Poor Americans at the Mercy of the Shutdown
    
    Tens of millions of Americans depend on the food-stamp program known as SNAP. Without federal assistance, many of them do not know how they will provide for themselves or their families. “The Daily” visits one of the communities most reliant on food aid. The Trump administration has agreed to restore some of the funding for SNAP, but there’s still uncertainty about how much money will come through, and when. Tony Romm, who covers economic policy and the Trump administration for The New York Times, discusses the fight over SNAP as the government enters its second month of shutdown. Guest: Tony Romm, a reporter covering economic policy and the Trump administration for The New York Times, is based in Washington. Background reading:  The Trump administration will send only partial food stamp payments this month.The cuts to SNAP have exposed President Trump’s strategy to use the government shutdown to advance his agenda.Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images For more information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.

    MURDERED: Christion Olson
    
    His friends brought him home saying he was drunk, but the truth tells a much different story.  18-year-old Christion Olson heads out for a night with friends on July 12th, 2024. But when he comes home early the next morning, the unimaginable happens. His family is left to grapple with tragedy while they search for answers. Only to be met with silence, shifting stories, and people that might be more interested in protecting themselves than sharing the truth.  Nearly everything about that night feels wrong—and maybe that’s why it seems like everyone there that night has something to hide… If you have any pertinent information about Christion’s case or the early morning hours of July 13th, 2024, on or around Topaz Lane, please contact the Brunswick Hills Police Department. The Chief of Police made a website specifically for Christion’s case which you can access HERE. You’ll find a number to dispatch, a link to send information straight to investigators, and ways to share a tip anonymously.  Head over to our Crime Junkie YouTube channel to WATCH this episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKImZhbbObE  Source materials for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

    Don't Poo — Vote!
    
    Barack Obama hits the campaign trail—and discusses Trump's sh\*tposting—as voters head to the polls. Donald Trump sits down for a lengthy interview with 60 Minutes—the same program he sued in 2024—to discuss immigration raids, his new fascination with nuclear weapons, and his surprising pardon of a Chinese crypto tycoon. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy discuss the interview's most shocking moments, share their final thoughts on the 2025 elections, and react to the garish Gatsby-themed party the President threw at Mar-a-Largo as SNAP benefits expired for more than 40 million Americans on Halloween night. Then, George Retes, the combat veteran and American citizen who was detained by immigration agents with no explanation while driving to work, stops by the studio and shares his harrowing story.

    Four Big Races To Watch, Partial SNAP Funding, Sudan Famine, Dick Cheney Dies at 84
    
    Voters in New York, Virginia and New Jersey choose new leaders today, and a redistricting vote in California could reshape the balance of power in Congress. The Trump administration says it will restart SNAP benefits, but only partially, leaving millions of families uncertain about how they’ll eat this month. Aid groups warn of a deepening crisis in Sudan after a paramilitary force accused of genocide seized the last major city in Darfur, killing thousands of people and trapping many more without food or water. And former Vice President Dick Cheney has died due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, according to a statement from his family. He was 84 years old.

    Amazon's Robot Takeover
    
    Over the past two decades, no company has done more to shape the American workplace than Amazon. In its ascent to become the nation’s second-largest employer, it has developed an aggressive corporate culture and pioneered using technology to hire, monitor and manage workers. Now, interviews and a cache of internal strategy documents reveal that Amazon executives believe their company is on the cusp of their next big workplace shift: replacing more than half a million jobs with robots. Karen Weise takes us inside Amazon’s push toward automation and the implications for the company and potentially for the broader economy. Guest: Karen Weise, a technology correspondent for The New York Times, based in Seattle.

    What to know as SCOTUS weighs Trump's tariffs
    
    The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on Wednesday for and against the legality of President Trump’s signature economic policy: tariffs. In this episode, a lawyer walks us through what’s at stake and how the major questions doctrine may come into play. We also consider whether it’s possible to repay the $90 billion accumulated in tariff revenue should SCOTUS rule against the president, and scrutinize potential ‘plan B’ tariff policies.

    The Millions of Poor Americans at the Mercy of the Shutdown
    
    Tens of millions of Americans depend on the food-stamp program known as SNAP. Without federal assistance, many of them do not know how they will provide for themselves or their families. “The Daily” visits one of the communities most reliant on food aid. The Trump administration has agreed to restore some of the funding for SNAP, but there’s still uncertainty about how much money will come through, and when. Tony Romm, who covers economic policy and the Trump administration for The New York Times, discusses the fight over SNAP as the government enters its second month of shutdown. Guest: Tony Romm, a reporter covering economic policy and the Trump administration for The New York Times, is based in Washington. Background reading:  The Trump administration will send only partial food stamp payments this month.The cuts to SNAP have exposed President Trump’s strategy to use the government shutdown to advance his agenda.Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images For more information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.

    Chicago Fights Back
    
    A federal judge once again blocked the Trump Administration from sending the National Guard to Portland over the weekend — but if Trump is successful in the courts, Portlanders can look to the great city of Chicago for a preview of what may be in store. Since ICE began operations in September, there have been violent raids on apartment buildings and near-constant activity from aggressive federal agents rounding up immigrants who are being kept in facilities reportedly full of cockroaches and with horrifying examples of overcrowding. And, in some cases, US citizens are getting detained, too. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has faced the brunt of Trump’s attacks on the city, while also reckoning with Chicago’s crime rate and affordability crises that many big cities also face. We sat down with the Mayor to talk about what it’s been like to face down the President while trying to manage the nation’s third-largest city. And in headlines, President Trump’s tariffs are at the Supreme Court this week, a rundown of the high-profile Election Day races, and 20 Democratic-led states sue the Trump administration over a rule that could block certain public servants from getting their student loans forgiven.

    Sora 2's disinformation problem
    
    OpenAI’s latest AI video generator Sora 2 has gotten a lot of attention for its realistic creations. The tool is supposed to have guardrails to prevent creating videos based on misinformation. But new analysis from watchdog group Newsguard found that, when prompted, Sora 2 often generated videos based on lies, such as false claims having to do with election fraud in a foreign country or that a toddler was detained by immigration agents. Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Sofia Rubinson, senior editor at Newsguard, to learn more.

    The Supreme Court battle over Trump’s tariffs
    
    The Trump administration faces a Supreme Court challenge on Wednesday over its use of tariffs, an economic policy that has upended global trade. This case, which has been described by the President in epic terms, questions the legality of Trump’s signature economic policy - and poses one of the biggest existential threats to his second term so far. In today’s episode, we speak to small business owners across the US, and to BBC business reporter Natalie Sherman, who will be at the Supreme Court this week. Producers: Hannah Moore and Valerio Esposito Executive producer: James Shield Mix: Travis Evans Senior news editor: China Collins Image: US President Trump unveils new tariffs on so-called Liberation Day.

    In the Dark, hosted by Madeleine Baran, is an award-winning investigative-journalism podcast that started in 2016. Its first season looked at the mysterious abduction of Jacob Wetterling in rural Minnesota and the lack of accountability that sheriffs face when they fail to solve cases. Season 2 examined the case of Curtis Flowers, who was tried six times for the same crime. In 2020, In the Dark released a special report on the coronavirus pandemic in the Mississippi Delta. In 2023, In the Dark joined The New Yorker and in 2024, it released “The Runaway Princesses,” a four-part series that asks why the women in Dubai’s royal family keep trying to run away. Season 3, released in 2024, asked why no one was punished for the killings of twenty-five civilians in Haditha, Iraq. In the Dark won the Pulitzer Prize for audio for Season 3. The podcast is a three-time Peabody Award winner and, in 2019, became the first podcast to win a George Polk Award, one of the top honors in journalism. The program has also received an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award and a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award. New Yorker subscribers get early, ad-free access.

    We’re at our most vulnerable when we go to our doctors. But what happens when we can’t trust them? Dr. Death is the award-winning series hosted by Laura Beil, now in its fourth season: Bad Magic. Need more Dr. Death? With Wondery+, you can listen to all episodes, unlock exclusive content, get early access to upcoming episodes, and enjoy an always ad-free experience. Start your free trial in the Wondery App or visit wondery.com/links/dr-death/ now. When a charismatic young doctor announces revolutionary treatments for cancer and HIV, patients from around the world turn to him for their last chance. As medical experts praise Serhat Gumrukcu’s genius, the company he co-founded rockets in value to over half a billion dollars. But when a team of researchers makes a startling discovery, they begin to suspect the brilliant doctor is hiding a secret. Season 3: Paolo is a smart and handsome surgeon, renowned for his ability to perform surgeries that transform his patients’ lives. When television producer Benita covers him for a story, he’ll transform her life too, but not in the ways she expects. As Benita crosses professional lines to be with him, she learns how far Paolo will go to protect his secrets. And halfway around the world, four doctors at a prestigious medical institute make shocking discoveries of their own that call everything into question. Season 2: If someone you love is diagnosed with cancer you want them to get the best treatment from the best doctors. In 2013, patients in Michigan thought Farid Fata was that doctor. Between his prestigious education, years of experience and pleasant bedside manner, Fata was everything you could want in a doctor. But he was not who he appeared to be. From Wondery, this is the story of hundreds of patients in Michigan, a doctor, and a poisonous secret. Season 1: We’re at our most vulnerable when we go to our doctors. We trust the person at the other end of that scalpel. We trust the hospital. We trust the system. Christopher Duntsch was a neurosurgeon who radiated confidence. He claimed he was the best in Dallas. If you had back pain, and had tried everything else, Dr. Duntsch could give you the spine surgery that would take your pain away. But soon his patients started to experience complications, and the system failed to protect them. Which begs the question: who - or what - is that system meant to protect? From Wondery, the network behind the hit podcast Dirty John, Dr. Death is a story about a charming surgeon, 33 patients and a spineless system.

    How did 9/11 the day become 9/11 the idea? That question drives Pineapple Street Studios and award-winning host Dan Taberski (Missing Richard Simmons, Running From COPS, The Line) to shift the focus to what happened on 9/12, and every day after that. 9/12 is a poignant, surprising, and surprisingly funny seven episode series about people who wake up on 9/12 having to navigate a new, radically altered world. A teenager gets caught up in an out-of-control conspiracy theory that he helped start. A Pakistani business owner finds hundreds of his Brooklyn neighbors are disappearing. Joke-writers at The Onion must figure out just how soon is “too soon”? 9/12 asks what it all means. We know what happened on 9/11. But what happened on 9/12 to alter our memory and our perspective forever? The series 9/12 earned three Podcast Academy Awards at the 2022 Ambies, including Podcast of the Year. Binge all episodes of 9/12 ad-free by joining Wondery+ in the Wondery App, Apple Podcasts, or Spotify. Start your free trial by visiting wondery.com/links/9-12/ now.
